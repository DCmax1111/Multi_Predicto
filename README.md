# Multi_Predicto
> A modular machine learning system for predicting prices, trends, and outcomes across multiple domains — laptops, phones, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and more.

## Overview

**Multi_Predicto** is built to demonstrate how different ML models perform on varied datasets.  
It uses a clean, step-by-step structure — from data loading and exploration to model training and evaluation — with a goal to make predictive modeling understandable and reusable.
